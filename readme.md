## Usage

To use the M&L project in your own code, follow the steps below:

1. Copy the project files:
   - Copy the necessary project files.

2. Import the core:
   - In your code, import the `core` from the M&L project. The exact import statement may depend on the file structure and location of the `core.js` file. Here's an example assuming it is in the same directory:

```javascript
import core from './core';
```

3. Use the core in your code:
   - Once imported, you can use the `core` in your own code. Here's an example using the `core` within a React functional core:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import core from './core';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <core />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

4. Customize the core:
   - If needed, you can customize the `core` according to your requirements. This may involve modifying the code within the `core.js` file or passing props to the core for dynamic behavior. Consult the documentation or source code of the M&L project for specific customization options.

5. Render the App:
   - Finally, render the `App` core or the root core of your application to see the `core` in action. This can be done using the `ReactDOM.render()` method.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Use Cases:
- Displaying M&L's portfolio: The `core` can be used to showcase M&L's stunning wedding photographs by rendering it within a page or section dedicated to displaying the portfolio.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import core from './core';

function PortfolioPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Portfolio</h1>
      <core />
    </div>
  );
}

export default PortfolioPage;
```

- Integrating with a contact form: The `core` can be combined with a contact form to create a complete solution for potential clients to view the portfolio and submit inquiries or booking requests.

These are just a couple of examples of how you can use the M&L project's `core` in your own code. Adapt the code to fit your specific use cases and requirements, and explore the project's documentation or source code for additional functionality and customization options.
